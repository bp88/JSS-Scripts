# 3/28/17 Edit: Updated for 10.12.4 compatibility. Added an additional exit codes and modified script to take into account which startosinstall command
# to use as Apple has modified the options in 10.12.4. Also added functions to reduce code re-use.
#
# 9/26/17 Edit: Updated for 10.13 compatibility. Cleaned up additional code logic. Added FV2 authenticated restart.
#
# This script is meant to be used with Jamf Pro.
# It will make sure of the macOS Sierra installer app along with some JSS script parameters and is intended to be somewhat easy to modify if used with future OS deployments.
#
# Required: Parameter $4 is for the required free space. Enter space in gigabytes such as 20. In this case, 20 would equal 20 gigabytes.
#
# Required: Parameter $5 is for the app name (e.g. macOS Sierra) which should hopefully allow some flexibility for the admin in case this script continues to work with the next macOS release.
#
# Required: Parameter $6 is for the time estimate in minutes. Type out the time in minutes.
#
# Optional: Parameter $7 is for the custom trigger name of a policy that should be used to deploy the macOS installer app.
# If you do not fill this in and the macOS installer app has not be installed on the computer, the script will exit and warn the user.
# You can opt to not use this parameter, but just make sure to deploy the macOS installer app through other means if that's the route you choose to take.
#
# Optional: Parameter $8 is used to provide a minimum OS version required to upgrade from. For example, you cannot upgrade to 10.12 on a computer running anything lower than 10.7.5.
# This is optional but if used it should be in the format of 10.7.5. Note: Some versions of macOS are written as 10.12. To verify, run this command in Terminal: sw_vers -productVersion
#
# Optional: Parameter $9 is used to determine if you want to check if iCloud Drive is enabled. Type "YES" (no quotes, case-insensitive) if you want to check otherwise leave blank.
# This script will check if iCloud Drive is in use. The reason for this is that macOS Sierra has a iCloud Documents sync feature which will upload documents to iCloud Drive.
# You may want the user to disable iCloud Drive and then push out a configuration profile to disable the iCloud Documents sync feature.
# This way when they re-enable iCloud Drive they do not have the option of possibly turning that specific feature on.
#
# Required: Parameter $10 is used to determine the full macOS installer app path. Enter the full path (e.g. /Users/Shared/Installer macOS Sierra.app)
#
# Optional: Parameter $11 is used to determine the minimum macOS installer app version just in case you want a specific version of the installer app on the computer.
# This comes in handy in situations where the computer might have the macOS 10.12.2 installer, but you want the 10.12.3 installer at minimum on the computer.
# Why? Apple may have released a specific feature (e.g. disable iCloud Doc Sync via config profile in 10.12.4+) that is in a newer minor update
# that you want to make use of immediately after computer has been upgraded.
#
# Variable 
#
# In case you want to examine why the script may have failed, I've provided exit codes.
# Exit Codes
# 1: Missing JSS parameters that are required.
# 2: Minimum required OS value has been provided and the client's OS version is lower.
# 3: Invalid OS version value. Must be in form of 10.12.4
# 4: No power source connected.
# 5: macOS Installer app is missing "InstallESD.dmg" & "startosinstall". Due to 1) bad path has been provided, 2) app is corrupt and missing two big components, or 3) app is not installed.
# 6: iCloud Drive is enabled. User must disable it.
# 7: Invalid value provided for free disk space.
# 8: The minimum OS version required for the macOS installer app version on the client is greater than the macOS installer on the computer.
# 9: The startosinstall exit code was not 0 which means there has been a failure in the OS upgrade.
# 10: The minimum OS version in macOS installer app has been supplied, but we were unable to mount the disk image to determine the OS version. Consider not providing a minimum OS version for macOS installer app.
# 11: Insufficient free space on computer.
# 12: Function parameter not supplied.
# 13: Could not determine the OS version in the macOS app installer. It's possible that in a future OS version that Apple may change their app installer and this script would need to be re-modified.
# 14: Remote users are logged into computer. Not secure when using FV2 Authenticated Restart.
# 15: FV2 Authenticated Restart is only supported on 10.9 and higher.
# 16: FV2 Status is not Encrypted.
# 17: Logged in user is not on the list of the FileVault enabled users.
# 18: Password mismatch. User may have forgotten their password.
# 19: FileVault error with fdesetup. Authenticated restart unsuccessful.
# 20: Failed to quit all applications before running the installer.
