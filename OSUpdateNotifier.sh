#!/bin/bash

# This script is meant to be used with Jamf Pro and makes use of Jamf Helper.
# The idea behind this script is that it alerts the user that the OS they are running is
# no longer supported. Rather than forcing updates through, this allows you to control the
# pace of notifications the user receives to perform the OS upgrade. If the user opts to
# proceed with the upgrade, they will get taken to a second policy that you've configured
# to do the OS upgrade.
#
# There are three optional dates that you can supply that will dictate the notifications
# the user receives.
# Start Date: This provides a notification to the user but also allows them to delay when
#   they will receive the next reminder.
# Nag Date: This provides a notification to the user. The user cannot select when to be
#   reminded. This will be set based on the re-notification period set by the admin.
# End Date: This provides a notification to the user when the update can take place. Once
#   this date has been reached, you can set it so that the user has X amount of attempts
#   left before they are forced to upgrade. User will receive a notification every 24 hour
#   24 hours until deferrals have been exceeded.
#
# Dates can be supplied in either epoch seconds or string format (e.g. Sep 03 12:34:56 -0400 2019)
# The notifications are meant to get increasingly more forceful.
# Because the dates are optional, you can either supply no dates, some of the
# dates (e.g. Start And End Date only), or all of the dates at your discretion.
# What this means is that the user will only see the notification after that date has been
# reached. If no dates are supplied, the user will simply get the same notification as if
# a start date had been set.
# Each date needs to be greater than the previous; your Start date can't be set to a date
# after the End date.
#
# With each notification, the "More Info" button in the Jamf Helper will always open up a
# URL. This URL should provide the user will instructions on how to proceed to update.
# Because it's a URL, you could also provide a Self Service URL as well if you want with
# the assumption you have a detailed description.
#
# This script does try to account for the fact that it's Self Service-centric. That means
# there are a few checks in place to try and give the user the best chance to perform the
# upgrade:
# -Ensure a user is logged in.
# -Power source is connected
# -No app is opened that has a display sleep assertion active
# -Idle time of the computer
#
# Given the above overview, here are the Jamf script parameters:
# Parameter 4: Optional. Enter "major" or "minor" which will dictate if the script alerts
#   against a necessary major OS upgrade or minor OS update. If not set, the default
#   will be "minor."
# Parameter 5: Optional. The custom trigger name for a Jamf policy that will initiate the
#   major OS upgrade.
# Parameter 6: Required. Provide the policy kicking off this script a custom trigger name
#   and supply it here. This is used for situations when the user tries to quit
#   Jamf Helper notifications.
# Parameter 7: Optional. The Start Date at which point the logic in this script will
#   provide the end-user a notification with the option to set when they will receive the
#   next reminder. If not set, the user will start to receive notifications the second
#   time the script is run based on the re-notification period. Date can be supplied in
#   epoch seconds or string format (e.g. Sep 03 12:34:56 -0400 2019).
# Parameter 8: Optional. The Nag Date at which point the logic in this script will provide
#   the end-user a notification which they can dismiss. User cannot select when to be
#   reminded as this is determined by the renotification period.
# Parameter 9: Optional. The End Date at which point the logic in this script will provide
#   the end-user a notification which they can defer only X amount of times (defaults
#   to 3 times). The user will get reminded every 24 hours until those deferrals have
#   been exhausted.
# Parameter 10: Optional. The re-notification period before the user will get the
#   notification again. This becomes applicable when you're passed the Nag date. Default
#   to 60 minutes.
# Parameter 11: Optional. The time out period in seconds which determines how long the
#   Jamf Helper notification will stay up. Defaults to 90 minutes.
#
#
# Unfortunately, there are not enough Jamf parameters available to use for all the
# customizations allowed in this script. Due to this limitation, there are other variables
# in this script you can change under the section titled "Variables You Can Modify":
# MaxDeferralAttempts: Required. Determines the number of deferral attempts a user has
#   after the end date has been reached.
# MaxIdleTime: Required. Number of seconds in which a computer has been idle for too long
#   to expect someone to be sitting in front of it. Script will exit if computer has been
#   idle longer than this time.
# MoreInfoURL: Optional. A URL that points the user to a page on the macOS upgrade process.
#   If left blank, this will default to Apple's macOS upgrade/update page which have been
#   active since September 2016. You can optionally use a Self Service URL.
# DelayOptions: Required. A list of comma separated seconds to provide delay options to
#   the user. The seconds will show up in Jamf Helper as time values. 3600 = 1 Hour
# ITContact: Optional. Enter either an email address, phone number, or IT department name
#   for the end user to contact your team for assistance. Defaults to "IT" if left blank.
#
# Verbiage:
# I've written the verbiage with the idea that the end user would open up Self Service 
# to perform upgrade macOS. Maybe this doesn't work in your environment because you don't
# have a Self Service workflow. Or maybe there's just something else you want to change in
# the verbiage. Below are the variable names so that you can alter the verbiage to your
# liking should you want to. There is a bit of variable logic inside the verbiage so
# modify at your own risk.
#
# Variable Names for the notifications:
# ReminderNotification: The text used when Start date has been reached or if no Start
#   date has been supplied.
# NaggingNotification: The text used when Nag date has been reached.
# FinalNotification: The text used when End date has been reached but there are still
#   deferrals left.
# FinalCallNotificationForCLIUpdate: The text used during a CLI update when End date has 
#   been reached with no more deferrals left.
# FinalCallNotificationForGUIUpdate: The text used during a forced GUI update when End
#   date has been reached with no more deferrals left.
# ShutdownWarningMessage: The text used just before shutting down.
# BackgroundInstallMessage: The text used when CLI updates are being actively performed.
#
# There are a few exit codes in this script that may indicate points of failure:
# 10: Required parameter has been left empty.
# 11: Make sure Start date < Nag date < End date.
# 12: Insufficient space to perform update.
# 13: /usr/bin/softwareupdate failed.
# 15: Incorrect property list type used. Valid types include: "array" "dict" "string"
#     "data" "date" "integer" "real" "bool"
# 16: Invalid date entered.
